# Vehicle Number Plate Recognition and Speed Measurement System :
With the growing number of vehicles on the road, monitoring traffic violations such as over-speeding has become a critical challenge for traffic authorities. Traditional speed detection methods, such as radar guns, are expensive and require manual operation, making them less efficient for large-scale monitoring. Similarly, manual number plate recognition is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to develop an automated system for vehicle speed detection, vehicle classification, number plate recognition, and text generation using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system processes recorded video data to detect vehicles, classify them into categories (such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles), estimate their speed using frame-by-frame motion analysis, and extract number plate details using Tesseract OCR. Additionally, Tesseract OCR is utilized for text generation, converting extracted number plate characters into machine-readable text for further processing and analysis. The implementation is carried out using Python, OpenCV, YOLO, NumPy, and Pandas, ensuring an efficient and easy-to-deploy solution. By automating traffic analysis, this project offers a cost-effective and scalable approach to identifying speed violations, classifying vehicles, generating text from number plates, and assisting in vehicle tracking, ultimately enhancing road safety and improving traffic management efficiency.
